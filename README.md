# Slime_Strider
Slime Strider is a simple top-down shooter made in the Godot engine by Jaleen Bowens-Kelly. Currently in Alpha, Slime Strider is still in active development and feedback is great! (Please critize my game!) Plan to release for HTML5 based websites, PC, and Mobile.

The current version is an Alpha of the game. The sprites are low quality, but it a place holder to make sure that everything works properly. Leave any comments about any bugs or any other features that I should add. The alpha is also availible on my itch.io page. Upcoming features:

Alpha:
*Turbo Boost (Y-Sppppeeeeddddd!!!)
*Missiles (Takes Ammo, deals a lot of damage in an AOE radius and knocks enemies over to the left a bit!)

Beta:
*Boss_Slime
*Enhanced Red_Slime( Move to the x axis and slight speed buff)
*Great Improvement to GUI, Sprites, and overall look of the game
*Bug Testing

Release:
*Ports to mobile, html5, and desktops
*Scoreboards maybe....
