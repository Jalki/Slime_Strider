# Slime_Strider
Slime Strider is a simple top-down shooter made in the Godot engine by Jaleen Bowens-Kelly. Currently in Alpha, Slime Strider is still in active development and feedback is great! (Please critize my game!) Plan to release for HTML5 based websites, PC, and Mobile.

*Alpha:
1) *Add mini-boss into game that scrolls along the x-axis and does not die until properly killed
  Incomplete
2) *Rechargeable turbo, that recharges base on the amount of damage you deal and time. Uncharges base on taking damage. Actively being in turbo increases speed and make you immune to damage for the duration.
  Incomplete
3) *Fast Slime moves x-ward and "bounces" when it touches x-boundary. Increases Speed by 10% for each bounce.
  Incomplete
4) *Add Missile Explosions that knocks slimes x-ward, if not kill them. Direct hits nerfed to 5 damage, but explosion deals 50 damage.
  Incomplete
5) *Internal Cooldown for energy weapon, which slows down rpm till overheat (Which is 1.25 seconds!). So holding down the space button for easy shots won't work forever. !Add Shader to represent this!
  Incomplete

*Beta:
Improve UI and Enemies looks and smooth out any remaining bugs!
  Incomplete
Scoreboards!
  Incomplete

Release:
*Ports to mobile, html5, and desktops
